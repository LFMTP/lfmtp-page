# LFMTP: Logical Frameworks and Meta Languages: Theory and Practice.

Type theories, logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common foundation
for designing, implementing, and reasoning about formal languages and their
semantics. They are central to the design of modern programming languages,
certified software, and domain specific logics. More generally, they
continue to influence applications in many areas in mathematics, logic and
computer science. The LFMTP workshops bring together designers,
implementers, and practitioners working on these areas.
