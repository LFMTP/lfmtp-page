It has long been recognized that necessity from modal logic and the
exponential of linear logic arise in the same way, namely from
categorical judgments.  There have also suggestions that necessity is
not atomic, but in fact composed of more primitive parts.  In this
talk we will report on our current understanding how necessity and
possibility may be decomposed and recombined along several dimensions:
structural properties (weakening and contraction), accessibility
properties (reflexivity and transitivity), and polarity (positive and
negative).  We consider some potential applications of this richer
viewpoint.
