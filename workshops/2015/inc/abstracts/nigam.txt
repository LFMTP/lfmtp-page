In this talk, we will review subexponentials, a refinement of linear
logic exponentials, and highlight their applications. We will discuss
their theory and show that a great number of systems can be specified as
linear logic theories with subexponentials. Examples include proof
systems for linear authorization logics and modal logics, and a number
of concurrent constraint programming languages, including languages
with spatial, epistemic and temporal modalities as well as soft
constraints.
