A variety of logical frameworks support the use of higher-order
abstract syntax in representing formal systems, however each
system has their own set of benchmarks. Even worse, general proof
assistants that provide special libraries for dealing with binders
provide a very limited evaluation of such libraries and the examples
given often do not exercise and stress-test key aspects that arise in
the presence of binders. In this paper, we propose and design an open
repository ORBI (Open challenge problem Repository for systems
supporting reasoning with BInders). We believe the field of reasoning about
languages with binders has matured, and a common set of benchmarks
provides an important basis for evaluation and qualitative
comparison of different systems and libraries that support binders,
and will help to advance the field.
