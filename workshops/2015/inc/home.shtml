<p>
Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for
representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive
systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their design and
implementation and their use in reasoning tasks ranging from the correctness
of software to the properties of formal computational systems have been the
focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This workshop will
bring together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss various
aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical frameworks,
including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and co-inductive
reasoning techniques and the expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning
process.
</p>
<p>
LFMTP 2015 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art
techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:
<ul>
<li>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages and
    related formally specified systems.
</li>
<li>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable
    binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about, datatypes
    defined from binding signatures.
</li>
<li>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and
    associated reasoning techniques.
</li>
<li>New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,
    contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting binders,
    functional programming over logical frameworks, homotopy
    type theory.
</li>
<li>Applications of logical frameworks, e.g., in proof-carrying architectures
    such as proof-carrying authorization.
</li>
<li>Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming
    languages such as Haskell, OCaml, or Agda and logic programming languages
    such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Friday,   May    1st</b>: Abstract submission deadline</li>
<li><b>Friday,   May    8th</b>: Submission deadline</li>
<!--   Friday,   June   5th    : Reviews due -->

</ul>


<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>
In addition to regular papers, we also solicit "work in progress" reports, in a broad sense.  Those do not need to report fully polished research results, but should be interesting for the community at large.
</p>
<p>
Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the <a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">EPTCS style guidelines</a>. The length is restricted to 15 pages for regular papers and 8 pages for "Work in Progress" papers.
</p>
<p>  
Submission is via EasyChair.

<h2>Proceedings</h2>
<p>
Accepted regular papers will be included in the proceedings, which will be
published in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science series
(<a href="http://about.eptcs.org/">EPTCS</a>).
