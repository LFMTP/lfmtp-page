                  SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 7 MAY 2015

Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science.  Their design and implementation and their use in reasoning tasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of formal computational systems have been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This workshop will bring together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.

LFMTP 2015 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:

* Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages
  and related formally specified systems.

* Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable
  binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about,
  datatypes defined from binding signatures.

* Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and
  associated reasoning techniques.

* New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,
  contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting
  binders, functional programming over logical frameworks,
  homotopy type theory.

* Applications of logical frameworks, e.g., in proof-carrying
  architectures such as proof-carrying authorization.

* Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming
  languages such as Haskell, OCaml, or Agda and logic programming
  languages such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.


Invited Speakers

* Frank Pfenning (Carnegie Mellon University)
* Vivek Nigam (Federal University of Para√≠ba)
* Marc Lasson (Inria)


Important Dates

Abstract submission deadline: Friday   May    1st
Submission deadline:          Friday   May    8th
Notification to authors:      Friday   June  12th
Final version due:            Friday   July   3rd
Workshop date:                Saturday August 1st


Submission

In addition to regular papers, we also solicit "work in progress" reports, in a broad sense.  Those do not need to report fully polished research results, but should be interesting for the community at large.  Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the EPTCS style guidelines. The length is restricted to 15 pages for regular papers and 8 pages for "Work in Progress" papers.  Submission is via EasyChair (link on the LFMTP 2015 web page).


Proceedings

Accepted regular papers will be included in the proceedings of LMFTP 2015, which will be published in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science series (EPTCS).
