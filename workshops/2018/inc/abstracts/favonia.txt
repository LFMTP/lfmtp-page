Recent research revealed the deep connection between type theory and homotopy
theory, which inspired a series of new type theories. The characteristic new
features are univalence and higher inductive types, which have led to a fruitful
development of synthetic homotopy theory. Unfortunately, those new features were
originally introduced as axioms and disrupted the computational content of type
theory, which affects their practicality in mechanizing proofs.</br></br>

To date, the most promising approach to enjoy new features inspired by homotopy
theory while retaining computational content is through cubical structure. Cohen
et al. constructed a type theory based on De Morgan cubes with both univalence
and higher inductive types. Influenced by their work, we also built a
type-theoretic semantics with all the features, but instead based on Cartesian
cubes. In addition to using a different cubical structure, our semantics is
built from computational content directly, following a computation-first
methodology which itself is interesting.</br></br>

<a href="http://www.redprl.org">RedPRL</a> is our first proof assistant based on
the new semantics, inheriting the PRL style pioneered by the Nuprl proof
assistant, which is also based on the computation-first methodology (but without
cubical structure). We are also developing different proof assistants with
distinct proof theories, in hope to create the best tools for mechanizing
homotopy theory and other mathematics.</br></br>

In this talk, I will describe how the computation-first methodology works,
compare two cubical type theories and discuss RedPRL.</br>
