\section{Scientific content}

Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for
representing, implementing and reasoning about a wide variety of
deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their
design, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from
the correctness of software to the properties of formal systems, have
been the focus of considerable research over the last two
decades. This workshop will bring together designers, implementors and
practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure
and utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable
binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the
expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.

LFMTP'18 provides researchers a forum to present
state-of-the-art techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the
following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages, logical systems and related formally specified systems.
\item Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about, datatypes defined from binding signatures.
\item Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and associated reasoning techniques, including inductive types of higher dimension in homotopy type theory.
\item Graphical languages for building proofs, applications in geometry, equational reasoning and category theory.
\item New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks, contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting binders, functional programming over logical frameworks, homotopy and cubical type theory.
\item Applications of logical frameworks: proof-carrying architectures, proof exchange and transformation, program refactoring, etc.
\item Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming languages such as Haskell, OCaml or Agda, and logic programming languages such as $\lambda$Prolog or $\alpha$Prolog.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Format of contributions}

LFMTP'18 is waiting for regular papers with up to 15 pages in the
EPTCS style. Submission is done through Easychair.

In addition to regular papers, we accept the submission of "work in
progress" reports, in a broad sense, up to 8 pages. Those do not need
to report fully polished research results, but should be of interest
for the community at large. Only regular papers will be published in
the proceedings though.

\subsection{Procedure for selecting papers}

Every paper will be reviewed by at least 3 PC members, possibly
with the help of external reviewers.

\subsection{Dates}

\begin{itemize}
\item Sunday, April 8th: Abstract submission deadline
\item Sunday, April 15th: Submission deadline
\item Tuesday, May 15th: Notification to authors
\item Friday, May 25th: Final version due
\item Saturday, July 7th: Workshop
\end{itemize}

\section{History}

  The proposed workshop continues the series of workshops on logical
  frameworks and meta-languages that started in 1999. It began with
  LFM and MERLIN, which were interleaved until 2005. These two
  workshops were merged in 2006 to form LFMTP, which has has grown
  into one of the main venues for presenting results on type theories
  and logical frameworks.
