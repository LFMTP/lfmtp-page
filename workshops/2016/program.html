        Mechanizing Proofs about Mendler-style Recursion

        We consider the normalization proof for a simply-typed lambda
        calculus with Mendler-style recursion using logical
        relations. This language is powerful enough to encode total
        recursive functions using recursive types. A key feature of our
        proof is the semantic interpretation of recursive types, which
        requires higher-kinded polymorphism in the reasoning
        language. We have implemented the proof in Coq due to this
        requirement. However, we believe this proof can serve as a
        challenge problem for other proof environments, especially those
        supporting binders, since our mechanization in Coq requires
        proofs of several substitution properties.

        A Rewrite System for Proof Constructivization

      <div>
          Proof constructivization is the problem of automatically extracting
          constructive proofs out of classical proofs. It is required to
          integrate classical theorem provers in intuitionistic proof
          assistants. We use the ability of rewrite systems to represent
          partial functions to implement heuristics for proof constructivization
          in Dedukti, a logical framework based on rewriting in which proofs are
          first-class objects which can be the subject of computation. We
          benchmark these heuristics on the proofs outputted by the automated
          theorem prover Zenon on the TPTP library of problems.

        The Logic of Hereditary Harrop Formulas as a Specification Logic for Hybrid

      <div>
          Hybrid is a logical framework that supports the use of higher-order
          abstract syntax (HOAS) in representing formal systems or “object
          logics” (OLs). It is implemented in Coq and follows a two-level
          approach, where a specification logic (SL) is implemented as an
          inductive type and used to concisely and elegantly encode the inference
          rules of the formal systems of interest. In this paper, we
          develop a new higher-order specification logic for Hybrid. By increasing
          the expressive power of the SL beyond what was considered
          previously, we increase the flexibility of encoding OLs and
          thus extend the class of formal systems for which we can reason
          about efficiently. We focus on formalizing the meta-theory of the
          SL. We develop an abstract way in which to present an important
          class of meta-theorems. This class includes properties such as
          weakening, contraction, exchange, and the admissibility of the cut
          rule. The cut admissibility theorem establishes consistency and also
          provides justification for substituting a formula for an assumption
          in a context of assumptions. It can greatly simplify reasoning about
          OLs in systems that provide HOAS. We present the abstraction and
          show how it is used to prove all of these theorems.

	Implementing HOL in an Higher Order Logic Programming Language

          We present a proof-of-concept prototype of a (constructive variant of
          an) HOL interactive theorem prover written in a Higher Order Logic
          Programming (HOLP) language, namely an extension of LambdaProlog. The
          prototype is meant to support the claim, that we reinforce, that HOLP is
          the class of languages that provides the right abstraction level and
          programming primitives to obtain concise implementations of theorem
          provers. We identify and advocate for a programming technique, that we
          call semi-shallow embedding, while at the same time identifying the
          reasons why pure LambdaProlog is not sufficient to support that
          technique, and it needs to be extended.

        The Incredible Proof Machine

      <div>
          Bringing the joy and excitement of interactive theorem provers to high
          school students is a challenge, because having to learn the rules of
          the syntax, and manually checking hand-written proofs is just not fun.
          Thus I created the Incredible Proof Machine, which allows students to
          conduct proofs by dragging blocks and wiring up them up to “proof
          graphs”, all using just the mouse. The result is a surprisingly
          addictive game-like experience that lures students (and non-students)
          to prove statements of propositional and predicate logic; or any other
          natural-deduction based calculus their instructor wants to teach.
          In this talk, I will explain the motivation behind the Proof Machine
          and its design decisions, demonstrate the user interface and its
          various features, show how to define your own tasks and even logics and
          outline the correspondence between these proof graphs and conventional
          natural deduction derivation trees.
