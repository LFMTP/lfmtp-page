Supernominal (co)datatypes form the basis of an expressive
mechanism for specifying and reasoning about syntax with bindings.
They are a generalization of the nominal logic datatypes having two
distinguishing features. First, they go beyond finite support,
catering for structures with infinite branching and/or infinite depth.
Second, they are compositional: Complex binding structures, such as
those proposed in the POPLmark challenge, arise naturally by composing
and iterating simpler patterns. Dedicated support for binding-aware
(co)recursion and (co)induction also follows from these constructions.
A prototype of supernominal (co)datatypes has been formalized in
Isabelle/HOL as an extension of the standard (co)datatypes and their
underlying Bounded Natural Functors (BNFs). An implementation as a
definitional package is under way.
