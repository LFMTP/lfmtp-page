We present a generic framework that facilitates object level reasoning with logics that are encoded within the Higher Order Logic theorem proving environment of HOL Light. This involves proving statements in any logic using intuitive forward and backward chaining in a sequent calculus style. It is made possible by automated machinery that take care of the necessary structural reasoning and term matching automatically. The framework can also handle type theoretic correspondences of proofs, effectively allowing the type checking and construction of computational processes via proof. We demonstrate our implementation using a simple propositional logic and its Curry-Howard correspondence to the lambda-calculus, and argue its use with linear logic and its various correspondences to session types.
