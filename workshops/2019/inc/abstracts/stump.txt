Cedille is a relatively recent tool based on a Curry-style pure type
theory, without a primitive datatype system.  Using novel
techniques based on dependent intersection types, inductive
datatypes with their induction principles are derived.  One
benefit of this approach is that it allows exploration of new or
advanced forms of inductive datatypes.  This paper reports work in
progress on one such form, namely higher-order abstract syntax
(HOAS).  We consider the nature of HOAS in the setting of pure type
theory, comparing with the traditional concept of environment models
for lambda calculus.  We see an alternative, based on what we term
Kripke function-spaces, for which Cedille confirms we have a weakly
initial algebra.  Progress extending this to support dependent
elimination is described.
