These days, vast amounts of knowledge are available online,
most of it in written form.
Search engines help us access this knowledge,
but aggregating, relating and reasoning with it is still a predominantly human effort.
One of the key challenges for automated reasoning based on natural-language texts
is the need to extract meaning (semantics) from texts.
Natural language understanding (NLU) systems
describe the conversion from a set of natural language utterances to terms in a particular logic.
Tools for the co-development of grammar and target logic are currently largely missing.<br/>

We will describe the <em>Grammatical Logical Framework</em> (<span style="font-family: Sans-Serif;">GLF</span>),
a combination of two existing frameworks, in which large parts of a symbolic, rule-based NLU system can be developed and  implemented:
the Grammatical Framework (<span style="font-family: Sans-Serif;">GF</span>) and <span style="font-family: Sans-Serif;">MMT</span>.
<span style="font-family: Sans-Serif;">GF</span> is a tool for syntactic analysis, generation, and translation with complex natural language grammars
and <span style="font-family: Sans-Serif;">MMT</span> can be used to specify logical systems and to represent knowledge in them.
Combining these tools is possible, because they are based on compatible logical frameworks: Martin-L&ouml;f type theory and LF.
The flexibility of logical frameworks is needed, as NLU research has not settled on
a particular target logic for meaning representation. Instead, new logics are developed all the time to handle various language phenomena.
<span style="font-family: Sans-Serif;">GLF</span> allows users to develop the logic and the language parsing components in parallel, and to
connect them for experimentation with the entire pipeline.
