The major issue addressed in autonomous data source management, notably within the framework of data exchange, is the variety of heterogeneous data schemas --- the forms the data must take. But semantics that give meaning to the factual data can be autonomous as well. In certain context such as Internet routing that lacks a central authority, both the data item --- distributed routing tables that collectively constitute a global path, and the semantic data --- polices that determine the selection of routing path, are independently managed by networks (autonomous systems (ASes)) participating in the Internet. A long standing networking problem is inflexible policy routing due to the lack of policy sharing mechanisms. This paper seeks to extend the classic data exchange framework to semantic data as a means to manage distributed, autonomous routing polices in the Internet. Specifically, we make the case of knowledge exchange, and use policy exchange as a driving problem --- a special case --- to understand the semantic framework of knowledge exchange: We identify several unique challenges, and illustrate how answer set programming --- originally developed for knowledge representation with negation and non-monotonic reasoning, and residue method based transformation --- originally developed for semantic query optimization, may serve as a point solution to the specific policy exchange problem.
