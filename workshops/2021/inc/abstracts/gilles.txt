We give a presentation of Pure type systems where contexts need not be
well-formed and show that this presentation is equivalent to the usual
one. The main motivation for this presentation is that, when we
extend Pure type systems with computation rules, like in the logical
framework Dedukti, we want to declare the constants before the
computation rules that are needed to check the well-typedness of their
type.
