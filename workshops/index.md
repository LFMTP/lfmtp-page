LFMTP continues a series of workshops on logical frameworks and meta-languages
that started in 1999. It began with LFM and MERLIN, which were interleaved
until 2005. These two workshops were merged in 2006 to form 
[LFMTP](http://lfmtp.org/), which has grown into one of the main
venues for presenting results on type theories and logical frameworks.
