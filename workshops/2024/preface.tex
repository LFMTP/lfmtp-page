\title{Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory and Practice}
\date{2024-07-08}
\maketitle

Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for
representing, implementing and reasoning about a wide variety of
deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their
design, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from
the correctness of software to the properties of formal systems,
have been the focus of considerable research over the last three decades.

The LFMTP workshop brings together designers, implementors and
practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and
utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable
binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the
expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.

The 2024 instance of LFMTP was organized by Florian Rabe and Claudio Sacerdoti Coen in Tallinn, Estonia, as a satellite event of the FSCD conference.
	We are very grateful to the conference organizers for providing the infrastructure and local coordination for the workshop as well as to EPTCS for providing the logistics of publishing these proceedings.
