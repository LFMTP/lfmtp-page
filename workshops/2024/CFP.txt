          Preliminary Call for papers -- LFMTP 2024

           Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages:
                   Theory and Practice

                       July 8, 2024
                 Affiliated with FSCD 2024

====================================================================

Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for
representing, implementing and reasoning about a wide variety of
deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their
design, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from
the correctness of software to the properties of formal systems,
have been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades.
This workshop will bring together designers, implementors and
practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and
utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable
binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the
expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.

LFMTP 2024 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art
techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:

* Design, Analysis, Implementation, Evaluation, and Application of logical frameworks like LF, Abella, Beluga, ELPI, Hybrid, lambdaPi, or MMT

* Encoding and reasoning about the theory of programming languages,
  logical systems, type theories, and similar formal systems

* Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable
  binding such as higher-order abstract syntax, nominal logic, explicit substituations, or binding signatures

* Representation and reasoning about features of logics and languages like equality, inductive and co-inductive definitions, inductive types of higher dimension, universes, as well as associated reasoning techniques

* Frontiers of logical frameworks such as canonical and substructural frameworks, contextual frameworks, functional programming over logical frameworks, or homotopy and cubical type theory

* Logical framework-based tools and services such as theorem proving, search tools, or IDEs

* Two-level languages to program and reason over logics like tactic languages, reflection, or meta-programming in interactive provers such as LTac, ELPI, MetaCoq, Isabelle, and Lean's meta-programming), including implementation and use cases
  
* Graphical languages for building proofs, applications in geometry, equational reasoning and category theory.


## Important Dates

Abstract submission deadline: April 29
Paper submission deadline:    May    6
Notification to authors:      June   3
Final version due:            June  13
Workshop:                     July   8

## Submission and Proceedings

We solicit regular papers of up to 15 pages (including references).
These must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another venue.
They will be reviewed, and we plan to publish (pre- or post-)proceedings in a series like EPTCS or similar.

In addition, we encourage the submission of abstracts (1-4 pages including references) describing work-in-progress, new ideas, challenges, or other interesting informal contributions.

All submitted papers should be in PDF format following the EPTCS style guidelines.

Submissions should be made via easychair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lfmtp24.

We will investigate the possibility of having a journal special issue for extended versions of selected contributions.

## Program Committee

* Florian Rabe (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg), co-chair
