   <h1>About</h1>

<p> Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their design and implementation on the one hand and their use in reasoning tasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of formal computational systems on the other hand have been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This workshop will bring together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressivity and lucidity of the reasoning process.  </p>

<p>
LFMTP 2013 will provide researchers a forum to present
state-of-the-art techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the
following: 
<ul>
<li>Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming
languages and related formally specified systems.</li>
<li>Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable
binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about,
datatypes defined from binding signatures.</li>
<li>Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and
associated reasoning techniques.</li>
<li>New theory contributions: canonical frameworks, contextual
frameworks, functional programming over logical frameworks.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This year's invited speaker are <a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale">Dale
Miller</a> (Inria), <a href="http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~furio.honsell/">Furio Honsell</a>,
