It is well known that, for β reduction of pure λ terms, the ξ rule is invertible:
<center> λx.s → λx.t ==> s → t </center>
With this observation we give a de Bruijn-like representation of pure λ terms, and rules for β reduction in this representation that need no rule ξ because rule ξ is admissible. This work has been formalized in Isabelle/HOL and proved adequate w.r.t. nominal Isabelle.
