The original presentation of uniform ordered linear logic does not
permit direct implementation (in Olli) as a meta-circular
interpreter. We explain the difficulty and present a new formulation of
the logic, called uniform atomic ordered linear logic which
does allow a direct transcription into a meta-circular interpreter. We
prove the new system sound and complete with respect to the old; and
we exhibit a meta-circular interpreter for Olli.
