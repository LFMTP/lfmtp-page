As a follow-up to the POPLMark Challenge, we propose a new
benchmark for machine-checked metatheory of programming languages: establishing strong normalization of a simply-typedlambda-
calculus with a proof by Kripke-style logical relations. We believe
that this case-study overcomes some of the limitations of the original challenge and highlights, among others, the need of native
support for context reasoning and simultaneous substitutions.
