SASyLF is an interactive proof assistant whose goal is to teach:
about type systems, language meta-theory, and writing proofs in
general. This software tool stores user-specified languages and
logics in the dependently-typed LF, and its internal proof structure
closely resembles M^+_2. This paper describes a new usability feature
of SASyLF, "where" clauses, which make explicit previously hidden
substitutions that arise from case analyses within a proof. The
requirements for "where" clauses are discussed, including a formal
definition of correctness. The feature's implementation in SASyLF
is outlined, and future extensions are discussed.
