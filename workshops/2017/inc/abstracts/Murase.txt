Under the Curry-Howard isomorphism, modal operators correspond to the type of closed code. Nanevski et al. generalized this
result and proposed the contextual modal type theory. They introduced the notion of context that corresponds to free variables of
code. Therefore the contextual modal type theory treats open code.
This paper provides another formulation of contextual modal
type theory: Kripke-style contextual modal type theory. Our type
system is based on the Kripke-style formulation of modal logic,
whereas the original system is based on the dual-context formulation. The resulting system has Lisp-like quasiquotation, and hence
we expect that KCMTT is adequate for the basis of syntactical
metaprogramming.
