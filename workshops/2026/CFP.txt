Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for
representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of
deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their design
and implementation, and their use in reasoning tasks ranging from the
correctness of software to the properties of formal computational systems,
have been the focus of considerable research over the past three decades.

The annual LFMTP workshop brings together designers, implementors, and
practitioners to discuss various aspects of the structure and utility of
logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive
and co-inductive reasoning techniques, and qualitative aspects of
reasoning including expressivity and lucidity.

LFMTP 2025 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art
techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:

* Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages,
  logical systems and related formally specified systems.

* Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable
  binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about,
  datatypes defined from binding signatures.

* Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and
  associated reasoning techniques, including inductive types of higher
  dimension in homotopy type theory

* Graphical languages for building proofs, applications in geometry,
  equational reasoning and category theory.

* New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,
  contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting
  binders, functional programming over logical frameworks,
  homotopy and cubical type theory.

* Applications of logical frameworks: proof-carrying architectures,
  proof exchange and transformation, program refactoring, etc.

* Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming
  languages such as Haskell, OCaml or Agda, and logic programming
  languages such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.

The workshop's program will include contributed and invited talks.


## Important Dates

Abstract submission deadline: May 9, 2026 (AoE)
Paper submission deadline: May 16, 2026 (AoE)
Notification to authors: June 6, 2026 (AoE)

## Submission

Submit on EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=lfmtp2026

In addition to regular papers, we welcome/encourage the submission of
"work in progress" reports, in a broad sense. Those do not need to
report fully polished research results, but should be of interest for
the community at large.

Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the EPTCS style
guidelines. The length is restricted to 15 pages for regular papers and
8 pages for "Work in Progress" papers.

## Proceedings

A selection of the presented papers will be published online in the
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).

## Program Committee

TBD
